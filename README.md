Always wanted to create a subset of metrics for repositores analysis? **Say no more!**

This project contains scripts for repositories analysis, and determining minimal metrics subset.
We also store metrics collected for Rust language repostories, currently over 75 metrics from over 170 repositores, collected using [ifcount tool](https://github.com/DCNick3/ifcount).
